# hello-world
Just another repository
To all that read this, I wish you well.   Well,  About me, I enjoy learning new things hence that is why I am here.  Not claiming to be a savant but an enthusiast autodidactic.  Life is long, along the way I look to be the best version of me at every stage of the game of life.  To grow and transition hopefully into a wonderful butterfly and not a frog.  The funny side of me will not allow me to leave out the following; I enjoy long walks on the beach, deep conversation, holding hands..... 

I hope that when you read this, that you smile.
